# markdown_combiner
Combines markdown files into a single markdown file

Copy the script into a folder with all the markdown files you want to convert.  Edit the content.txt file for the order you want the original markdown files to appear in the final markdown output file.  Then edit the md_combo.py file for your file names and run it.
